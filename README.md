# Price_Forecasting_Matlab
The objective of this project is to develop a robust ARIMA model that can effectively capture the underlying patterns and dynamics of electricity prices. This involves selecting appropriate model parameters and optimizing the model's performance.		
Forecast electricity prices: Use the developed ARIMA model to generate accurate forecasts for electricity prices. These forecasts will help market participants anticipate price fluctuations and make informed decisions.
Evaluate forecast accuracy: Assess the performance of the ARIMA model by comparing its forecasts with actual electricity prices. Key performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), will be employed for evaluation.
Provide insights for stakeholders: Communicate the results and findings to stakeholders, including energy traders, consumers, and policymakers. Offer recommendations for utilizing the electricity price forecasts effectively.
